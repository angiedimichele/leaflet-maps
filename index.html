<p> This map was created by Angela DiMichele to show the various places Bansky murals were spotted during his month-long takeover of New York City, which he dubbed "Better Out Than In." Banksy is an artist from England whose identity remains anonymous since his arts' inception in the 1990s. Fans of his art, which often center around political and social issues, are fascinated by his work and his anonymity.
